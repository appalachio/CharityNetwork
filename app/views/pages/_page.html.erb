    <div class="collapse-content text-sm">Many of our neighbours are fleeing unimaginable violence. In the process, they've lost almost everything. The future seems bleak.

With your help, they can begin to pick up the pieces to start again. One important way is to help them furnish their new home.

Through this website, we connect generous donors with local charities to ensure gently-used household items can find a new home.</div>

    <p>
    Q. What about picking up and dropping off donations?
    </p>
    <p>

    <br>
    <p>
    Q. What are examples of household items?
    </p>
    <p>

    Q. What is gently used?
    </p>
    <p>
    A. Gently-used' is tricky to define. Before donating something, perhaps ask yourself if someone in your family would accept the donation if they needed it. If the answer is yes, this website is for you!

    <br>
    <p>
    Q. What about large, bulky items like china cabinets, office cabinets and sectional couches?
