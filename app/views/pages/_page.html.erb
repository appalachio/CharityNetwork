    <div class="collapse-content text-sm">Many of our neighbours are fleeing unimaginable violence. In the process, they've lost almost everything. The future seems bleak.

With your help, they can begin to pick up the pieces to start again. One important way is to help them furnish their new home.

Through this website, we connect generous donors with local charities to ensure gently-used household items can find a new home.</div>

    <div class="collapse-content text-sm">
      <p><strong>How do I get in touch with you to give furniture?</strong><p>
      <p>After verifying the items we take and don’t take, you can drop them off at our warehouse, 1455 Michael Street, Unit 3 in Ottawa, Wednesdays from 6 pm to 9 pm and Saturdays 10 am to 1 pm. You no longer need an appointment. You can also fill out a Request for Pickup by HWF Truck. Please make sure to book reasonably in advance. We do book quickly.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Do you charge for furniture pickups?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes. When you complete a Request for Pickup by HWF Truck, you’ll see a breakdown of the pickup rates.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>What items will you take and not take?</strong></p>
      <p>Please refer to our list of items that we accept and don’t accept. We do not accept extra large or heavy items, soft furniture used by animals or smokers, torn or unclean soft furniture. We reserve the right to refuse items that do not meet our standards of condition. Our volunteers have the authority to make this final decision when you drop off your furniture.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Do I have to prepare items for drop off?</strong></p>
      <p>Furniture must be clean and of a quality that we would take in our own homes. Dishes, linens and small items must be boxed or packed, identified as to contents. Loose pieces of related items (e.g. nuts, bolts, screws of beds, tables with legs, TV’s with remotes) must be tied or taped together.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Do you take mattresses?</strong></p>
      <p>Yes. They must be in good condition, unstained, no rips. If possible, in a plastic bag.</p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Who can I contact if I have items you don’t take?</strong></p>
      <p>The City of Ottawa provides a list of places that will take used items. You can reach them here. </p>
